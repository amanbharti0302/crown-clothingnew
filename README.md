# What Is React?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with React.Component

# How to fork and clone
One quick note about cloning this project. If you wish to make commits and push the code up after cloning this repo, you should fork the project first. In order to own your own copy of this repository, you have to fork it so you get your own copy on your own profile!

You can see the fork button in the top right corner of every GitHub project; click it and a copy of the project will be added to your GitHub profile under the same name as the original project.

After forking the project, simply clone it the way you would from the new forked project in your own GitHub repository and you can commit and push to it freely!

# npm : Node Package Manager 
I always prefer to use npm rather than using yarn as nowadays npm is more advanced than yarn and it is pretty easier to use and setting configuration files.

In your terminal after you clone your project down, remember to run either `yarn` or `npm install` to build all the dependencies in the project.

# How to run:
To run react Project on your local server use `npm start`
